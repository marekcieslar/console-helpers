This repository contains a collection of `.sh` scripts designed to help streamline your work in the terminal. Each script provides a specific functionality to make your command-line experience more efficient.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you can create an alias in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`). Here is an example of how to create an alias for one of the scripts:

```sh
alias myscript='path/to/your/script.sh'
```

Replace `path/to/your/script.sh` with the actual path to the script you want to use. After adding the alias, you can simply type `myscript` in the terminal to execute the script.
